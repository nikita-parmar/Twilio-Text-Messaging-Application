# Twilio-Text-Messaging-Application

Built a text message app for a company. 

Company will be placing their phone number on an advertisement on TV in order to capture phone numbers of potential customers. 

In order to legally opt in customers, users will need to text a keyword to the phone number to gather consent. 

Company will then be able to send messages to users in the form of blasts (multiple users at once) or individual messages (messages to a specific user).
